# Responsive-Website-Design


Soooo hey hey :) this is the President - I coded all of this from scratch. woot woot! I'm gonna explain some terms and stuff real quick so you understand. Don't be scared!


**web development terms!**
<header> tags have <stylesheets> and responsive stuff in it so you can also go on mobile with the website. cool, right? stylesheets make it look SEXY. Sometimes you can grab styleshets from websites and boop it in!

<body> this is what you see, basically. It's the structure of your site.

<a> tags are usually for links and can sandwich in anything you want a link with. #LetsGetThisBread


In this example, a href means it links your image "img" to blah.com. alt text is used to describe our picture. Remember, <img> doesn't need a closing tag!!!

<img> as described, img shows images. up above, I showed in our example on how to link it. 

<div> is a part of your code to separate it from everything.

<i></i> basically means slanting and italicizing your word or text... :)

<b></b> is bolding your words!

<br> is a line break

<section> is 'bigger' and the older brother to div. He's cooler.

<p> is paragraph text, and <h1,2,3,4,5> is header text.

<span> is the fake-cool version of paragraph <p>, it thinks its' cool, and acts like it. But it's basically the cousin to <div> and <section>

<ul> stands for unordered list and MUST be the bread part of the sandwich for <li>, list elements. you can put as many <li> ingredients as you want, but if you don't sandwich them inside <ul> and </ul>, maaaaan you are missing OUT.

<footer> the bottom part of your website! usually there is a left aligned footer and a right aligned footer within it.


# Wait wait... I see stuff in quotations everywhere?!?!
Sooooo yeah. If you see something like, <span class = "swag"> or something, the swag part references something in our own personal CSS thingy. **CSS**, or cascading style sheets, helps us see what the HECK we're looking at, and it makes it look good :)

In this case, the "swag" part is styled a certain way for our span class. Go look at it in the stylesheet! For reference, our stylesheet is linked in the header on each page.

# What now?!

Okay, whew! now that **THAT** is over, let's move on!!
I commented out some stuff on each page so you can re-factor everything when you're a new officer. Wooo! By the time you have read this I have probably contacted OTS Service Desk to link this on the Clubs page. If not, go talk to them. They're smart.
